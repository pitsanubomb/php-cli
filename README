Take The xml in question . 

1. Please write a php cli script which can be called like this:
  # php importPropertyFromXml.php  --filePath=[C:\Documents\propertyCreate1.xml]
and it will import the data from xml into the database . You should have atleast the following tables and define relationship between them:
  properties  : property information table
  images      : image table
  features    : features table. you can make up the features like featureA,featureB with the IDs that matches your xml
  geodata     : table to store address ( like country id , province id , postal code id , latitude , longitude etc )


2. Please write a second php cli script which prints out the property information that you had just inserted.  in the given language. if the selected language is not found , you can default to english.

for example : 
   # php showProperty.php --language=th

   id              :		1
   title           :		Noble Revolve รัชดา 2    
   address         :        .....    
   ....			   :		.........


    # php showProperty.php --language=en

   id              :		1
   title           :		Noble Revolve Rachada 2    
   address         :        .....    
   ....			   :		.........


   # php showProperty.php --language=bn                 ( unkown language tag will default to english language)

   id              :		1
   title           :		Noble Revolve Rachada 2    
   address         :        .....    
   ....			   :		.........
